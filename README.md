#### Description:
The ReactNative-HealthTracker-App is a simple yet effective tool designed to assist users in monitoring their health conveniently. Developed using React Native and JavaScript, this app provides a user-friendly interface with features such as a calendar view and asynchronous storage for persistent data. Its primary aim is to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers by facilitating better health monitoring compliance and enhancing clinical judgment.

As a clinical physician, I often encountered challenges related to patient health monitoring compliance. Many patients defaulted on their monitoring routines, which hindered my ability to accurately assess their clinical conditions. This frustration inspired me to create the ReactNative-HealthTracker-App, with the hope of improving patient engagement and facilitating more effective communication between patients and healthcare professionals.


## Features include:
### Calender View
The app offers a calendar view that allows users to track their health data over time. This feature provides a visual representation of their progress, making it easier to identify trends and patterns in their health metrics.

### Asynchronous Storage
To ensure that users' data is securely stored and readily accessible, the app utilizes asynchronous storage. This means that even if the user exits the app or reboots their device, their health data remains intact and can be retrieved whenever needed.

### Fast and Responsive
Built using React Native and optimized for performance, the app delivers a smooth and responsive user experience. Whether navigating through the calendar or inputting new health data, users can expect snappy responsiveness and minimal lag.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
Thanks to its use of Expo and React Native, the app is compatible with both iOS and Android devices. This cross-platform support ensures that users can access the app regardless of their preferred mobile platform.

### One Click Data Reset
For users who wish to start fresh or clear their existing health data, the app provides a convenient option to reset all data with a single click. This feature offers flexibility and empowers users to manage their health data according to their preferences.
